## Hi! 👋

I'm Isabel, a PhD Fellow researcher in Linguistics with a focus on **Computational Linguistics**, **Corpus Linguistics**, and **Terminology**. My work explores how linguistic theory can be translated into computational models, with particular attention to methodological rigour, interpretability, and reproducibility.

I primarily work with annotated corpora and supervised learning approaches, combining linguistic analysis with statistical and machine learning techniques.

### 📐 Research Perspective

I approach NLP as a **linguistically informed discipline**. Models are useful tools, but not explanations in themselves. My work therefore emphasises:

- interpretability of linguistic features  
- critical evaluation of model behaviour  
- careful and conscious corpus design  
- theory-driven experimentation
